A FIGlet library (which should kick asses, or not)

# This is work in progress!

It does not work. Wait a bit until it's finished.  
Here are the things to do before we have something to release:  
- [x] Loading font
- [x] Full size rendering
- [ ] Fitting rendering
- [ ] Smush rendering?
- [x] Rendering on buffer
- [ ] Meta character rendering (such as marking with colors)
- [ ] CI
- [ ] Nuget
- [ ] Zip support
