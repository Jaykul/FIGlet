# This is work in progress!

It does not work. Wait a bit until it's finished.  
Here are the things to do before we have something to release:  
- [x] Loading font
- [ ] Monospaced render
- [ ] Variable width render
- [ ] Kerning render
- [ ] Smush ?
- [ ] Rendering on buffer
- [ ] Meta character rendering (such as marking with colors)
- [ ] CI
- [ ] Nuget
- [ ] Zip support
